done 1) remove Image::isLoaded method, refact Image::load
2) improve 3d model format, refact importexport.cpp
done 3) add Buffer::setSubData method, use it for update bonesbuffer
done 4) why aren't there setting up projMatrix to Renderer in CameraPrivate::pickNode ?
done 5) Use current file path for pre-compile shaders
done 6) develop shadow maps
7) change Model::Animation representation
decline 8) remove scale from utils::Transform
done 9) add supporting viewProjection and modelViewProjection matrices in shaders
done 10) improve rendering pipline in Renderer class. Now we have a conflict when we are trying to render shadow maps and common scene
11) ScenePrivate::renderScene updates all dirty shadow maps. It should update shadow maps that are needed in this frame
done 12) develop BackgroundDrawable
done 13) develop TextNode, loading fonts (https://evanw.github.io/font-texture-generator/)
14) why is base color black when there are no lighting ?
done 15) develop AutoTransformNode that is always oriented to camera
done 16) replace bounding spheres to bounding boxes for scene graph
17) sometimes shading jumps on static models (it depends with autocalculating z-planes for frustum of light)
done 18) textdrawable is based on texturedmeshdrawable now. That's why it has vec3 positions instead of vec2. texturedmeshdrawable has to support any-dims positions.
19) Renderer::loadTexture calls glGenTexture. If smth is wrong loadTexture'll return nullptr without glDeleteTexture. texId will be broken.
20) move SSAO radius from defines to uniforms.
21) Implement Image::loadDescription method.
