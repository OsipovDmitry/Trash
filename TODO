done 1) remove Image::isLoaded method, refact Image::load
2) improve 3d model format, refact importexport.cpp
done 3) add Buffer::setSubData method, use it for update bonesbuffer
done 4) why aren't there setting up projMatrix to Renderer in CameraPrivate::pickNode ?
done 5) Use current file path for pre-compile shaders
6) develop shadow maps
7) change Model::Animation representation
8) remove scale from utils::Transform
9) add supporting viewProjection and modelViewProjection matrices in shaders
10) improve rendering pipline in Renderer class. Now we have a conflict when we are trying to render shadow maps and common scene.
